Created to house some play around golang stuff, the folder dim holds a finished command line app that
allows for easy prefix management of docker images through adding or removing new prefix's to 
whole sets.

Dim also has my simple implementation of a linux command line options provider, it is uncoupled and
allows other apps to specify their own options easily.
